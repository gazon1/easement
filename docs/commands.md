## Everyday commands

Start from the code as it is: `easement init` finds the components in the layout of the project and allows every dependency it sees between them.

```text
$ easement init
easement: wrote easement.yml with 4 components and 5 allowed dependencies; remove the dependencies that should not exist, then run `easement check`
```

```yaml
rules:
  handlers: { may_depend_on: [repository, services] }
  repository: { may_depend_on: [models] }
  services: { may_depend_on: [models, repository] }
```

Then say what the architecture should be. Handlers should not reach the storage directly, so drop `repository` from their allowances and give the reason:

```yaml
  handlers:
    may_depend_on: [services]
    because: handlers go through services, never straight to storage
```

`easement check` now points at the code that breaks the rule, like any linter:

```text
$ easement check
internal/handlers/books.go:6: handlers -> repository is not allowed (written as internal/repository/books.go) [dependency]
  because: handlers go through services, never straight to storage

easement failed: 1 violation(s), 0 stale, 0 legalized; 5 files, 6 internal deps, 1 files outside components
```

It exits 0 when the code matches the config, 1 on violations and 2 on an error (a broken config, a missing indexer); 3 and 4 come from `--cache-only` and `--require-evidence`. Fix the import (or, if it is right, the rule) and run it again.

The commands you will use most:

```sh
easement init                 # write a starting easement.yml
easement check                # check the project
easement check --diff main    # only what this branch adds, see Diff mode
easement baseline             # record today's violations; later runs only shrink it
easement explain <file>       # which component a file is in and what it may do
easement why <a> <b>          # the imports, or the chain, behind a -> b
easement propose <file> <target>  # the decision on an import not written yet, and what it does to the graph
easement impact --diff main   # every file that depends on what this branch changed
easement review --base main   # what this branch's change to the policy permits and accepts
easement suggest              # allowances nothing uses, imports nothing allows
easement doctor               # are the indexers the project needs installed
```

`easement --help` and `easement <command> --help` list the rest: the report formats for CI, `graph`, `schema`, `--watch`, the cache flags, shell completions (`easement completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_easement`). The text report is coloured on a terminal; `--color auto|always|never` overrides that, and `auto` honours `NO_COLOR` and `CLICOLOR_FORCE`.

## init

`easement init` finds the components in the layout of the project (the subdirectories of `internal/`, `src/`, `app/`, … or the top-level directories) and allows every dependency it finds between them. The first `easement check` passes; remove the dependencies that should not exist, and add `because:` reasons.

## suggest

`easement suggest` reads the real graph against the config and lists:

- the `may_depend_on` entries no dependency uses;
- the dependencies that nothing allows, and those the config forbids;
- the arrows of the diagram that no dependency stands for;
- the components whose instances never depend on each other and so could be `isolated` (only `*` patterns, never `**`).

An entry next to files no indexer covered is listed apart as unreliable, because the dependency it would remove may be in a file that was never read. Check those by hand before removing anything. `--format json` gives the same lists as data (`removable`, `unreliable`, `not_allowed`, `forbidden`, `stale_arrows`, `isolation`), each item next to unread files with `unread`, the files of each component no indexer read, and the `evidence_gaps`, `accepted_gaps` and `cached` of `check`.

- `--patch` prints the removals as a patch: `easement suggest --patch | git apply`. It edits the text of `easement.yml`, so comments and `because` reasons stay, and it never touches an entry next to unindexed files. An entry it cannot place (a rule that comes from `extends` or an alias, a list written over several lines) is named on stderr to remove by hand.
- `--check` prints the same report and exits 1 while an unused entry is left that `--patch` would remove, so a CI step keeps the allowances from piling up.

## impact and why

`easement impact <paths>` lists every file that depends on the given files or directories, directly or through others, grouped by component: what a change can break and which tests to run. `--diff <base>` adds the files changed since the merge-base, and `--format json` gives `changed` and `dependents`. When files were not covered by an indexer, `evidence_gaps` says so, because dependents through them are missing.

`easement why <a> <b>` says whether the config allows `a -> b` and why, then lists the imports behind it with file and line, each alias a line writes as a hop from the line through the definition of every alias to the file (`gw/gw.go:5 -> chunk/chunk.go:9 -> blob/blob.go`), or, when there is none, the shortest chain of imports from `a` to `b`.

`--format json` gives the same answer as data. `why` carries the `decision` on the pair (`allowed`, the `grant` or the clause it is `rejected_by`, the `rules` it breaks: `dependency` for a direct dependency and `reach` for a chain under `must_not_reach`, `because` and `provenance` as in `check`), each direct dependency in `dependencies` with the `decisions` on what is written at its line, the rules it `violates` and, for an alias written there, its `aliases` as typed `hops` with the file they `end` in, or the `chain` with the file it `end`s in, with `evidence_gaps`, `accepted_gaps` and `cached` as in `impact`. `explain` carries the `ownership` of the path (`status` `owned`, `unowned` or `excluded`, the `component`, the `pattern` that owns it, its `captures`, `instance`, whether it is `test` code or `target_only`, and where the component is defined), the component's `grants`, `prohibitions` and `not_allowed` with the same decision fields, its `public` surface, `surfaces` and `allow_importers`, and its `rule`. A path no component owns is an error in text and a status in JSON.

`easement graph --focus <component>` draws only that component and the ones it shares an arrow with.

## propose

Before writing an import, `easement propose <file> <target>` says what the policy will make of it: the dependency decision `check` would give the import, with the grant that allows it or the rule that rejects it and its `because`. A target outside the public surface of its component is rejected as `privacy`, and the report names the surface. `--external <module>` proposes an external module instead of a path. Neither path needs to exist: what decides is the path, so a new file is judged as the component, instance and slice it would land in, and a file of a Go package as the package.

The proposal is also laid over the project's graph, and the report lists what it would add there: a new component cycle, a new `must_not_reach` chain, a crossed `max_fan_out` or `max_instability`, a dependency the diagram has no arrow for. Each comes with a witness, the steps that make it, at the file and line of an existing import or naming the proposal, so a cycle reads as the shortest one through a proposal:

```text
src/checkout/pay.ts -> src/billing/api/charge.ts: allowed by may_depend_on (checkout -> billing)

What they do to the graph:
  component dependency cycle: checkout -> billing -> checkout [cycle]
    checkout -> billing: proposed: src/checkout/pay.ts -> src/billing/api/charge.ts
    billing -> checkout: src/billing/api/charge.ts:1
```

`--plan <file>` (or `-` for stdin) judges several at once, a JSON list of `{"from": ..., "to": ...}` and `{"from": ..., "external": ...}`, and lays them over the graph together: two proposals that are allowed alone can close a cycle together, and the consequence names both. `--format json` gives `proposals` (one decision each: `allowed`, `rejected`, `unowned`, `excluded` or `target_only`, with `grant`, `rule`, `message`, `because` and `public_surface`) and `consequences` (each with `witness` and the indexes of its `proposals`), with `narrowed`, `evidence_gaps`, `accepted_gaps` and `cached` as in `check`.

The baseline and suppressions never apply: they are for code that is already written. A source no component owns is `unowned`, a rejection (`orphan`) under `strict` unless `unowned` lists it; a source `exclude` hides is `excluded`, and one `target_only` names is `target_only`: `check` never reads their imports, so no rule judges them. A cycle names every proposal that makes an edge of its group of components, not only those on the shortest cycle shown. A test-only part of a file (Rust's `#[cfg(test)]`) cannot be proposed: only the test globs make a path test code, and the report notes it for such a file. The graph's evidence gaps (files no indexer read, test code not told apart) carry over. `--no-graph` judges the decisions alone, without scanning the project, and the report is `partial` for it. It exits 0 when every decision and consequence passes, 1 when one fails (a rule in `warn` is reported but does not fail), and 2 and 3 as `check` does; it takes `--config`, `--no-cache` and `--cache-only` like `check`.

## doctor

`easement doctor` looks at the languages the project has and says, for each, whether its indexer is on the `PATH`, which version, and whether what it needs is in place (`node_modules` for TypeScript, `composer install` for PHP). For a missing indexer it prints how to install it and, where mise can, the lines for the `[tools]` of a `mise.toml`.

It exits 1 when something is missing, so a script or an agent can run it first and read `--format json`.
