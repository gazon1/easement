## Comparison with other tools

Most architecture checkers are tied to one language. `easement` is not a replacement for them where they go deeper; it is for projects that want one model across several languages.

| Tool | Languages | Level of analysis | Rules are written as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `easement` | Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Java, Rust, C#, Ruby, Kotlin, PHP, Swift | imports between files and packages, symbols used, type names, declared packages | one YAML file |
| [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) | Java (and other JVM languages through bytecode) | classes, methods, annotations, inheritance | JUnit tests in code |
| [dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) | JavaScript, TypeScript | imports between modules | JS or JSON config |
| [import-linter](https://github.com/seddonym/import-linter) | Python | imports between modules | INI or TOML contracts |
| [Deptrac](https://github.com/deptrac/deptrac) | PHP | classes, collected into layers | YAML |
| [arch-go](https://github.com/arch-go/arch-go) | Go | packages, functions, naming | YAML |
| [depguard](https://github.com/OpenPeeDeeP/depguard) | Go | import allow and deny lists | `golangci-lint` config |

Where `easement` differs:

- **One config, one baseline, one report.** A repository with a Go backend and a TypeScript frontend gets the same component model, the same suppressions and the same CI output (`sarif`, `github`, `junit`) for both.
- **The compiler's view, through SCIP.** Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, PHP, Java, C# and Ruby are resolved by their SCIP indexers, so aliases, `tsconfig` paths and re-exports are what the compiler sees; Kotlin and Swift are read with tree-sitter and nothing has to build. The price of the indexers is that dependencies have to be installed (and, for Java and C#, the project built), which ArchUnit, working on compiled classes, also asks for.
- **Adoption and review features built in.** A baseline for existing violations, `--diff` to judge only what a pull request adds, `--scope` for a part of the project, and `extends` for shared policy in a monorepo.
- **One static binary.** No runtime to install in CI.

Where the others are stronger:

- **Depth.** `easement` judges imports, the symbols used through them (Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust and Ruby), which component a type name belongs to ([`defines`](configuration.md#names-of-types)) and indirect reach through the methods a call references ([`reach: symbols`](configuration.md#reaching-through-others)). It has no rules about inheritance, signatures, annotations or other class and member properties (ArchUnit), nor about package contents or function limits (arch-go).
- **Kotlin and Swift.** They are read with tree-sitter, not a compiler, so what a build system would resolve there is approximated.

Using both is reasonable: keep a language-specific tool for the deep rules of one codebase and let `easement` hold the boundaries between components and languages.

`easement` puts one component model, one config and one baseline over all of them.
